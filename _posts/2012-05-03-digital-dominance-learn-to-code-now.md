If you want to thrive in the exploding information economy of the 21st Century, it is essential that you learn to understand, write, and think in code.

[Software Is Eating The World](https://href.li/?http://on.wsj.com/ICxERu) – Wall Street Journal

Mathematics has been called the queen of the sciences because it stands over all the other sciences. It’s a meta-science. Computer science is increasingly taking on the same role. I don’t mean computer science in the technical, track of study, sense. I mean the ability to break down a problem into logical units and apply computational processes to solve it.

Artificial intelligence is already here. Every piece of executable code is a collection of intelligent agents ready to tirelessly do someone’s bidding, and the segment of people who command those agents will rule the world. The digital divide is not about the haves and have-nots, it’s about those who can code and those who can’t.

The good news is that it’s not too late for you. I’m going to lay out everything you need. The three websites bellow compromise your academy. They offer video tutorials that can be consumed at a meager rate of ten minutes a day.

\3. [w3schools.com](https://href.li/?http://www.w3schools.com)

The three websites that follow are your interactive tools. They will make your learning experience fun and enjoyable. Code is fun! You just have to learn the rules of the game. They are also socially engaging so you can begin to show off what you’re learning.

jsFiddle is your new coding environment. You will work through and save all of your lessons there. By doing this, you will be able to go back and reference them. It’s also the most effective way to ask questions of other programmers.

Lastly, this is your community of new friends. When, not ‘if’, you have questions, Stack Overflow will be the single most rewarding place for you to be, both to be helped and to help.

\- [stackoverflow.com](https://href.li/?http://stackoverflow.com)

In conclusion, let me encourage you as a fellow student. You can do it! You must do it. Keep going and don’t give up. Cultivate humility. No matter how 1337 you think you’ve become, there are code ninjas, wizards, samurais, and pirates that are incomprehensibly better. Welcome to the gild.
