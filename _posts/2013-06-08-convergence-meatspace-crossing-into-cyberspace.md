Real world objects are going online vie ’[the internet of things](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)’ and the Internet is breaking into the real world via [3d printing](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing). The Internet of things describes a state in which all the objects around you are connected to and controlled through the Internet. Door locks, Refrigerators, lamps, cars, lights, TV’s etc. This can be seen as the real world of objects spilling over into the domain of cyberspace.

[What happens when objects start to post their position and status on the internet? Amazing things.](https://href.li/?http://singularityhub.com/2010/04/27/building-an-internet-of-things-video/)

3d printing on the other hand enables one to easily produce perfect physical copies of digital objects. This makes it possible for anybody to plug his or her computer into a printer and instantiate objects made by anyone else on the Internet. The convergence of these technologies means that things in the real world are reaching out and connecting to the Internet and the objects of cyberspace are being created in the real world.
