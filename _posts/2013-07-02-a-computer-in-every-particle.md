There’s this old story about two computer scientist talking passively about what the future of computers would be. The one scientist mentions that eventually computers would get to be small enough to fit on the tip of your finger. The other engineer sneered at the idea and retorted “Why the heck would we ever need a computer that small?!” Fast forward fifteen years and the two professors are checking into a hotel for a conference. They go to enter the room and look down to realize that there were now indeed, micro computers in every hotel room handle that responded to specifically coded key cards.
