I am truly shocked that so many people are being duped by BlackBerry’s recent announcement of their tablet, the PlayBook. I have read endless comments from people who are saying they can’t wait to get this tablet computer. Well, I think I have some bad news for you folks.

There is no evidence that the PlayBook exist as advertised.

Why do I say this? I will make it brief.

\1) There is not a single frame in the BlackBerry PlayBook commercial that shows the actual device! The only thing being seen in the commercial is CG special effects. Don’t believe me? Watch the ad again. Sure, those special effects are amazingly fast and responsive and cool but where is the device?



Remember the ads for the BlackBerry Torch? They were entirely done with special effects too. The Torch seemed so fast and cool in those ads. The only problem is the actual real phone didn’t operate nearly as good as it did in the CG ads. The BlackBerry Torch ads are awesome but the phone is crap. Take note.



\2) The PlayBook was never demoed at the Live Announcement. The dude is supposedly holding the device in his hands and he doesn’t touch the screen once. Let me repeat that. He never touches the device once! The screen never changes and it never gets dark. I cant help but wonder if he’s just holding a dummy (plastic) device. 



Compare this to Apples iPad announcement. There was a frigin camera over Steve Jobs shoulder while he operates the actual device. If this PlayBook is so cool, why not actually show it off?

\3) No one in the public has even been able to touch the PlayBook. Once again, compare this to the iPad announcement. Every one who attended the iPad announcment was actually able to handle and touch the device. They had tons of them on tables for every one to test out. What did the attendees of the PlayBook announcement get? A device encased in glass playing videos. The new OS isnt shown once, just a repeating video ad. Why not let everybody test out that amazing screen and new os? Judging by the video, that glass encased PlayBook with the wire attached could just be a dumb lcd screen. Is there a single shred of evidence to say otherwise?



\4) Just look at BlackBerry’s last venture in touch screen gadgets, the Storm and Torch. Need I say more. Given the above considerations, whats more likely? That a company went from the Storm and Torch phones to the PlayBook in this short period of time as or that things are not as BlackBerry is making them to appear?

I will admit, I could be wrong. I would be happy to be proved wrong, I just don’t think that that’s going to happen.
