**1. Human**

This level of emulation represents human level intelligence. A program running at this level of sophistication would display the intelligence of man, generically speaking. Like a souped up [Watson](<https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)>).

**2. \*A\* human**

This level of human emulation simulates a unique software agent, an [‘intelligent’ agent](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent). An emulation at this level changes over time and is capable of modifying the way in which achieves its objectives.

**3. A \*particular\* human**

The entials the ability to take the entire i/o of a particular person and simulate it such that it’s indistinguishable to others. This is where the mind uploading questions will enter in because, it could be reasoned, that if you can make a software copy of you while you’re still alive then what reason do you have to believe that it’s actually 'you’ in software form post [mind upload](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading)?
